## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was having issues getting my setting functions to work, the options were trying to change the theme style color of the app and language of the app.
I had issues with the Discount calculator because I had two fields and it was issue changing the alpha of each field and onChange of both of them.
